Simply-Chip8 is a basic Chip-8 interpreter/emulator for Linux. It emulates all CPU instructions as they appeared on the COSMAC VIP!

Note: This is my first attempt at a major project written in C. I've decided to write a CHIP-8 interpreter since emulation has always been an interest of mine. A rewrite is in progress.

### Usage
```
./simply-chip8 CHIP8_PROGRAM CPU_CYCLE_DELAY_IN_MS
```

### Not Implementing:
- Sound timer
- Super Chip-8 additional instructions

### Future Plans:
- Debug window
